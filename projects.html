                <p class="paragraph">
                    I partnered with a Senior Programmer on Encounters where we took ownership from designers and fully refactored the entire system. With <em>Nightingale</em> being a live service game 
                    we also consulted our designers to identify and alleviate as many inefficiencies as possible in the data authoring process and level markup to ensure a sustainable content pipeline with quick turnover. 
                    <br><br>
                    I then had the opportunity to move to the AI team with the primary goal of bridging the gap between Encounters and creatures. By obtaining a 
                    greater understanding of our AI systems, we were able to decouple Encounters from AI, define a solid bridge, and make much needed improvements to both systems.
                    <br><br>
                    I also had the opportunity to mentor interns and junior programmers, and represent Inflexion Games at various outreach events supporting
                    Alberta's growing media industry.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a privilege to work with an undeniably talented team at Inflexion Games and ship my first game. This was my 
                    first real foray into the game industry and I'm incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to work with this team on <em>Nightingale</em>. 
                    I was given the environment to make mistakes, pursue my interests, and take ownership of my systems.

                <ul class="paragraph md:text-sm list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Refactored combat Encounters to support Storied Realm bosses, improve small space combat, and revamp enemy distribution
                        for <em>Realms Rebuilt</em>, <em>Nightingale’s</em> largest update, helping push its Steam score from a ”Mixed” 63% to a ”Very Positive” 83%.
                    <li>Took ownership of Encounters from designers, nativized its core systems, introduced persistence, replication, automated
                        testing, gameplay debugger data, and level design tools, ensuring its robustness, extensibility, and readability.
                    <li>Spearheaded data authoring improvements for Encounters including streamlining POI markup, automating creature
                        distribution, and validation, resulting in a 80% reduction in bugs and significantly reducing time spent authoring and debugging.
                    <li>Created an editor tool to preview and validate EQS queries, virtually eliminating creature-spawning bugs.
                    <li>Expanded the capabilities of our spawning system by providing a way to easily author and query EQCs in C++, enabling
                        bespoke spawn locations, allowing ordered and weighted spawning based on creature data, and deleting 97% of EQS assets.
                    <li>Nativized the spawning system in Encounters and unified its data into data assets, reducing asset dependencies by 99%,
                        streamlining the creature spawning setup, and increasing the system’s extensibility.
                    <li>Refactored the presentation system for Encounters to support fully diegetic player communication, removing the need for
                        replication in Encounters’ core systems, and defining the foundation for Encounters’ rewards.
                    <li>Collaborated closely with other teams, acting as the primary point of contact for Encounters, ensuring that new features and
                        the vision of the game were consistently realized through code, and the integrity of other systems was maintained.

                    I worked with Joseph for more than two years at Inflexion Games. 
                    When Joseph started, I was assigned to work with him as his mentor in order to show him the ropes and to get him started at the studio. 
                    Within a few months Joseph had taken on increasing responsibility, had made valuable contributions to the game, and had begun to assert 
                    himself positively by actively participating in design discussions as well as making excellent suggestions for how we could improve our systems. 
                    As time went on, Joseph only increased his capabilities in programming, design, and communication. Joseph is also friendly and easy to work with, 
                    and I have no doubt that he would be able to fit in well with any team. In short, Joseph is an excellent programmer and communicator, and tops 
                    things off by being an all-around good guy to work with. I would recommend him for just about any programming role.

                    I managed Joseph on the AI team for several months during his time at Inflexion Games. 
                    He was always willing to learn new and better ways to solve technical problems, and, of his own volition, he would use those learnings to improve already existing systems. 
                    Additionally, he was always jumping in to help support less technical team members with their problems. 
                    Any team seeking a self-driven, highly collaborative member would benefit from having Joseph.

                    Joseph made our lives as gameplay and level designers significantly easier through improved automation and the development of tailored tools that streamlined our workflows and eliminated sources of error. 
                    His proactive approach and deep understanding of our processes allowed us to focus more on creativity and polish, saving time and improving outcomes. 
                    Joseph’s responsiveness and collaborative spirit ensured that every concern or request was met with practical, effective solutions, often exceeding expectations. 
                    Whether debugging issues, integrating features, or enhancing systems, his work was consistently impactful, reliable, and delivered with a genuine commitment to supporting the team.

                    I was lucky enough to hire and subsequently manage Joseph during his time at Inflexion.
                    Joseph is one of the best up-and-coming developers I have had the pleasure of working with. His professional strengths are his diligence, passion, and high self-standards. 
                    This, coupled with his wonderful and warm personality, makes him an excellent team member and even better co-developer to partner with.
                    Joseph would be an asset on any team, particularly those making use of Unreal Engine or C++ for game development. 
                    Joseph has worked in a number of sub-disciplines in gameplay development in Unreal, such as AI and the Gameplay Ability System Plugin. 
                    He has also worked excellently in cross departmental partnerships using his strong communication skills.
                    I anticipate Joseph becoming an even more exceptional programmer and game developer over time, and would be a great addition to any programming team.

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

                    I had the opportunity to work in one of Calgary's few game studios on an ambitious multiplayer city builder RTS. I shared my time 
                    between web development and game development, obtaining a solid seven months of experience in Unity. Zugalu had just restarted development 
                    on <em>Thrive: Heavy Lies the Crown</em> so I had the opportunity to develop core systems for the game from the ground up.
                    <br><br>
                    I also worked on various web development contracts including the website redesign of <a href="https://nscad.ca/" class="text-draplin" target="_blank">NSCAD</a> where I
                    lead the development of the project and working directly with our clients.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm incredibly grateful to Zugalu for giving me the opportunity to start my game development career and represent Calgary's growth in

                    Joseph is the kind of person who approaches every challenge with determination, creativity, and humility. 
                    Whether it’s tackling a tough coding problem or collaborating with a team, his drive and positive attitude set him apart. I have no doubt that his future contributions will leave a lasting impact on the gaming industry.
