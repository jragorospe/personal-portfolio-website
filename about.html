        <h2 class="mb-2 pt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Humble Beginnings</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            My family and I immigrated to Canada when I was a toddler. Growing up in Canada has been an incredible privilege, one
            that has been allotted due to the hard work and sacrifice of my parents. Hard work, gratitude, and a heart for service are
            values instilled in me from the very start and I carry them in everything I do.  
            <br><br>
            Some of my favourite past times have been playing games. I still have vivid memories of every time I received a console, the craziest of 
            which was when my godfather unexpectedly handed me a Nintendo 64 after church. It was an incredible console but my 
            favourites were the PSP and Nintendo GameCube. Playing Patapon 2 and MGS: Peace Walker on road trips to the States and countless hours
            of Super Smash Bros. Melee cemented my love for video games. 
            <br><br>
            Growing up, it never occurred to me that I could be the one to make experiences like these for others. But in hindsight, 
            my dream of being an inventor and my love for music, the world of game development was a perfect match for my analytical and artistic brain.
            It's a realization that has been suppressed by the need for practicality but it's never to late to start the pursuit.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mb-2 pt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Overcoming Hardship</h2>
        <p class="paragraph block mb-5">
            University was a time for exploration and growth. I pursued a Computer Science degree at the University of Calgary and
            a minor of Philosophy. I have always had a knack for solving problems and people-problems are definitely the most
            interesting to me, especially in relation to ethics. 
            <br><br>
            Despite my interest in school, my University experience was not that great.
            At the start, a lot of things were happening in my life. My parents were going through a rough patch in their marriage, and my girlfriend 
            was diagnosed with Stage 4 melanoma. This caused my grades to plummet as I burried myself in work instead of acknowledging my anxiety.
            <br><br>
            I found myself in academic probation twice, failing to meet the requirements both times. Having my parents find the letter to withdraw 
            from the University and writing the appeal, forced me to acknowledge that these issues were effecting me more than I was willing to
            admit. I sought help from mentors and friends and was able to overcome my anxiety issues. My girlfriend beat cancer, we got married,
            my parents sorted out their marriage, and I was able to complete school in 5 years, going from a 1.0 GPA to 3.4 GPA.
            <br><br>
            I'd like my story to be a reminder that you can overcome what seems impossible at the time with the help of others. Whenever I'm 
            reminded of this time of my life I remember Arnold Schwarzenegger's address to the students at the University of Houston.

            <div class="bg-black rounded-lg p-5 mb-4">
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2 dark:text-gray-600 text-sm">
                        ‚ÄúI always tell people that you can call me anything that you want. You can call me Arnold. 
                        You can call me Schwarzenegger. You can call me the Austrian Oak. You can call me Schwarzie. 
                        You can call me Arnie. But don‚Äôt ever ever call me a self-made man. 
                        <br><br>
                        This is so important for you to understand. I didn‚Äôt make it that far on my own. I mean, to accept that credit or that 
                        mantle would discount every single person that has helped me to get here today ‚Äî that gave me advice, that made an effort, 
                        that gave me time, that lifted me when I fell. It gives the wrong impression that we can do it alone. None of us can. 
                        The whole concept of self-made man, or woman, is a myth.‚Äù

        <p class="paragraph">
            During University, I had the oppourtunity to work at Shokunin during the height of its popularity with the launch of Netflix's, 
            <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V088HvtuQFg" target="_blank">The Final Table</a>. Our chef was one of the finalist on the
            show, which garnered him celebrity status and an influx of new clientele. I've had the privelege to work with world class chefs,
            interact with high profile clients, and work with the most talented team. 
            <br><br>
            I am eternally grateful for Shokunin. It was an incredibly impactful oppourtunity, teaching me important teamwork and management skills, 
            how to work in a high stress environment, and was pivotal for helping me move out and paying for my University. 
            <br><br>
            Now I am pursuing my passions as a game developer, hoping to make an impact through the experiences I create. I am priveleged to
            have been given the oppourtunity to work in the game industry in Calgary, a city where the industry is virtually non-existent. I'm 
            currently at <a class="inline-link" href="https://zugalu.com" target="_blank">Zugalu</a>, helping to create 
            <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=thrive+heavy+lies+the+crown" target="_blank">Thrive</a>,
            a medieval city builder inspired by the likes of Anno and Total War. I continue to stay diligent in my learning and hope to make my mark on the industry some day.
